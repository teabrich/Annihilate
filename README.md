# Annihilate
A platform game designed by Amelia Mattrick, Hannah Dodson, and TÃ©a Brich

We created a platform game using Unity. We were able to change and modify the terrain and background. We also imported a new assets to add sound effects and background music. To play this game you need the assets folder and Unity. To play our game, press the start button and then click on the screen and use the arrows keys to move and the space bar to jump. You have to avoid minor obstacles and collect as many cherries as possible. We made it by modifying the 2-D platform game on Unity Hub.

In order to play this game you need to make sure you download adn unzip the file, open the entire folder in Unity, you also need to have the Pixel Adventure 1 assest folder in hwich you can download for free in the Unity Asset Store and then click the play button on the screen/Unity platform to begin the game.
